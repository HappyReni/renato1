                <p style="margin-top: 45px;">Around 7000 BCE, the indigenous peoples of Mexico
                    and Central America hunted game and gathered plants, including wild chile
                    peppers. Corn was not yet cultivated, so one main source of calories was roasted
                    agave hearts. By 1200 BCE, corn was domesticated and a process called
                    nixtamalization, or treatment with lye, was developed to soften corn for
                    grinding and improve its nutritional value. This allowed the creation of
                    tortillas and other kinds of flat breads.[42] The indigenous peoples of
                    Mesoamerica had numerous stories about the origin of corn, usually related to
                    being a gift of one or more gods, such as Quetzalcoatl.</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 45px;">After the Conquest, the Spanish introduced a
                    variety of foodstuffs and cooking techniques, like frying, to the New World.[46]
                    Regional cuisines remained varied, with native staples more prevalent in the
                    rural southern areas and Spanish foods taking root in the more sparsely
                    populated northern region.[47] European style wheat bread was initially met
                    unfavorably with Moctezuma's emissaries who reportedly described it as tasting
                    of "dried maize stalks". On the Spanish side, Bernal Díaz del Castillo
                    complained about the "maize cake" rations on campaign.</p>
